Abstract:
An indeterminate string x = x [ 1 . . n ] on an alphabet Σ is a sequence of nonempty subsets of Σ ; x is said to be regular if every subset is of size one. A proper substring u of regular x is said to be a cover of x iff for every i ∈ 1 . . n , an occurrence of u in x includes x [ i ] . The cover array γ = γ [ 1 . . n ] of x is an integer array such that γ [ i ] is the longest cover of x [ 1 . . i ] . Fifteen years ago a complex, though nevertheless linear-time, algorithm was proposed to compute the cover array of regular x based on prior computation of the border array of x . In this paper we first describe a linear-time algorithm to compute the cover array of regular x based on the prefix table of x . We then extend this result to indeterminate strings.
